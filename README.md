# Object-detection-using-TensorFlow


This project demonstrates **real-time object detection** using a pre-trained TensorFlow model on the COCO dataset.
It takes an input image, detects objects, and visualizes results with bounding boxes, labels and confidence scores.

# Features
- Uses a TensorFlow pre-trained object detection model
- Supports COCO dataset (90 object categories)
- Draws bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores
- Visualizes results using OpenCV and Matplotlib
